\section{Introduction}
In this short paper we will show that the Quadratic Formula can be derived from completing the square of a Quadratic Equation. In section \ref{sect:prelims} we will introduce what a quadratic equation is, the idea and process of completing the square of a quadratic equation, and the quadratic quadratic formula. In section \ref{sect:derive} we will derive the Quadratic Formula. Finally in section \ref{sect:application} we will discuss applications of the Quadratic Formula and the importance of it within mathematics.\\\\
It is additionally worth mentioning that throughout this paper we will be working over the set of real numbers with quadratic equations that only yield real solutions. 

\section{Preliminaries} \label{sect:prelims}
First we will begin by defining a quadratic equation.
    \begin{defi}\label{def:quadratic}
    A quadratic equation is a polynomial of degree two which can be represented in the standard form\hfill\\
    $$ax^2+bx+c=0$$
    The variable $x$ represents an unknown number belonging to the set of real numbers, and $a, b, $ and $c$ represent known numbers that belong to the set of real numbers.\\
    Additionally, the values of $x$ that satisfy the quadratic equation are known as the equation's roots or zeroes. For the sake of working specifically over the set of real numbers a quadratic equation can have at most two real roots.\\
    \end{defi}
    \begin{defi}\label{def:compSquare}
    Completing the square of a quadratic equation is the process of taking a quadratic polynomial in standard form,\\
    $$ax^2+bc+c=0$$
    and converting it to form,
    $$a(x-h)^2+k$$
    where $h$ and $k$ belong to the set of real numbers.
    The process of completing the square can be broken up into elementary steps as such.\\
    Given standard form quadratic equation, $$ax^2+bx+c=0$$
    divide the equation by a so that $x$ no longer has a coefficient, $$x^2+\frac{bx}{a}+\frac{c}{a}=0$$
    Subtracting $\frac{c}{a}$ from both sides of the equations yields, 
    $$x^2+\frac{bx}{a}=-\frac{c}{a}$$
    Additionally we will add $(\frac{b}{2a})^2$ to both sides of the equation to give us,
    $$x^2+\frac{bx}{a}+(\frac{b}{2a})^2= -(\frac{c}{a}) + (\frac{b}{2a})^2$$
    The left side of the equation can be reduced to a perfect square, and moving the terms from the right side of the equation to the left of the equation yields, 
    $$(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2+\frac{c}{a}-\frac{b^2}{4a^2}=0$$
    Notice that we have an equation in the form of $a(x-h)^2+k$, where $h = -\frac{b}{2a}$ and $k=\frac{c}{a} - \frac{b^2}{4a^2}$.
